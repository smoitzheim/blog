This theme is a port of [11ty Brook Dev by Template Deck](https://templatedeck.com/brook-html-template.html). 

I admire their theme and work. I tried to use Brooke but I ran into complications with the Table of Contents and footnotes not working as well as the theme not working with 11ty Version 3.0.0. Should anyone wind up using this theme please give credit and gratitude to 
Holger KÃ¶nemann and Template Deck for their creative use of the bootstrap template and for making such a lightweight and useful theme for blogging.
